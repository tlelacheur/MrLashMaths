- Tree diagrams are used to list the outcomes for multiple-step experiments and events
- As for two-step experiments, subsequent trials can be:
  - independent / with replacement (same probability applies)
  - dependent / without replacement (the previous trial determines the probability)
- Each trial is listed vertically
- Final outcomes - go along the branches from left to right, multipling probabilities.
- If many outcomes are required (OR), add the probabilites.

Example 5.1
Lucy is her soccer team penalty taker. She has a probability of 0.8 of scoring any penalty.

If Lucy takes 3 penalty kicks, what is the probability that:
    a) She'll score all 3?
    b) She'll score exactly 2?
    c) She'll score at least 2?
    d) She'll score at least 1?
