## Probability Review

* The probability of an event in which all outcomes are equally likely is given by: 

$$Pr(\text{X}) = \dfrac{\text{Number of positive outcomes}}{\text{Total outcomes}}$$ 

* For all events $0 \leq Pr(X) \leq 1$
- A sample space is a *set* of all the possible outcomes
- The complement of an event $X$ is the probability that it does not occur:  
  $$Pr(\text{not }X)=Pr(X')=1-Pr(X)$$

#### Examples

    Example 1.1:  
    A letter is randomly chosen from the word AEROPLANE.  
    Find the following probabilities.
    
    a) Pr(R)  
    b) Pr(not R)  
    c) Pr(vowel)  
    d) Pr(consonant)  
    e) Pr(consonant or an A)  
    f) Pr(vowel or consonant)

    Example 1.2:  
    A six-sided die is rolled and the uppermost face is observed and recorded.  
    Find the following probabilities.
    
    a) Pr(6)  
    b) Pr(not a 3)  
    c) Pr(prime number)  
    d) Pr(number less than 3)  
    e) Pr(a square number)
