## Probability Review

* The probability of an event in which all outcomes are equally likely is given by: 

$$Pr(\text{X}) = \dfrac{\text{Number of positive outcomes}}{\text{Total outcomes}}$$ 
* For all events $0 <= Pr(X) <= 1$
- A sample space is a *set* of all the possible outcomes
- The complement of an event $X$ is the probability that it does not occur:  
$$Pr(\text{not }X)=1-Pr(X)$$

  
#### Examples

	Example 1:  
	A letter is randomly chosen from the word AEROPLANE.  
	Find the following probabilities.
	
	a) Pr(R)  
	b) Pr(not R)  
	c) Pr(vowel)  
	d) Pr(consonant)  
	e) Pr(consonant or an A)  
	f) Pr(vowel or consonant)
