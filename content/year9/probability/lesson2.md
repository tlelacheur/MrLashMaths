### Venn Diagrams

A Venn diagram is a way to display the elements of a set. We can used them in probabilty to display the number of outcomes of a particular event especially if there are overlapping outcomes.

For example:  
Display in a Venn Diagram the outcomes of rolling a die for:

- $Pr(A)$ rolling an event number
- $Pr(B)$ rolling a prime number

```math
||{"id":526581189939}||
```

### Two-way Tables

A two-way table can also be used to display the same data as a two-set Venn Diagram.

For example:  
Display the information above in a two-way table:

```math
||{"id":224049988548}||
```

#### Examples

    Example 2.1:  
    A survey of 25 people found that 18 people like comedies and 12 like action movies. Also, 8Â people like both comedies and action movies and 3 like neither comedies nor action movies.  
    
    a) Construct a Venn diagram for the survey results  

```math
||{"id":1202011389160}||
```

    b) How many people:  
        i) like comedies  
        ii) do not like action movies  
        iii) like only comedies?  

```math
||{"id":1116124509556}||
```

    c) If one of the 25 people is randomly selected, find:  
        i) Pr(likes comedy and action)  
        ii) Pr (likes neither comedy nor action)  
        iii) Pr(like action only)  

```math
||{"id":1241208540428}||
```

    Example 2.2:  
    Thirty people at a gym are asked about their gym usage. Of these, 18 people attend classes, 19 people use the gym equipment and 8 people attend classes and use the equipment.
    
    a) Illustrate the situation using a two-way table.

```math
||{"id":231738420181}||
```

    b) How many of the people:
        i) do not attend classes?
        ii) neither attend classes nor use the equipment?

```math
||{"id":1656463767674}||
```

    c) Find the probability that a randomly selected person:
        i) uses the gym equipment
        ii) only attends classes
        iii) attends class or uses the gym equipment

```math
||{"id":936848676284}||
```
