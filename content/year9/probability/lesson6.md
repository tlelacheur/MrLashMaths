### Relative Frequency

The relative frequency (the ratio of positive outcomes of an experiment) can be used to determine the experimental probability of an outcome. 

If the probability of an outcome is unknown, an experiment can be conducted to see how often the desired outcome occurs. As the *sample size* increases the *experimental* probability *tends* towards the *theoretical* probability.

$$\text{Relative Frequency}=\dfrac{\text{Positive Outcomes}}{\text{Number of Trials}}$$

Example 6.1
A weighted die is rolled 200 times, the following outcomes were observed:
```


<center>
<table border=1 style="border-collapse:collapse; padding: 5pt; text-align:center">
  <tr>
    <td>  Number  </td>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>2</td>
    <td>3</td>
    <td>4</td>
    <td>5</td>
    <td>6</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Freq</td>
    <td> 18 </td>
    <td> 32 </td>
    <td> 25 </td>
    <td> 29 </td>
    <td> 23 </td>
    <td> 73 </td>
  </tr>
</table>
</center>


```
Using this data, calculate the:
    a) Experimental Pr(6)
    b) Experimental Pr(odd)
    c) Expected number of 5's rolled if the die is rolled 50 times.

Example 6.2
A biscuit jar contains an unknown number of biscuits and a biscuit is drawn from the jar and then replaced. The procedure is repeated 50 times and the type of biscuit drawn is recorded each time. 

Thirty choc-chip biscuits were recorded.

Find the:
    a) experimental probability for selecting a choc-chip biscuit. 
    b) expected number of choc-chip biscuits if 200 trials are conducted.
