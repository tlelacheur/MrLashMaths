### Sets

- A set is a group of *elements*, often defined by a *rule*.

- Sets are defined using curly brackets $\{\text{ } \}$

```
Example 3.1

List these sets:

1. {arrangements of the letters ACT}

2. {mulitples of 4 less than 20}
```

### Set Notation

- The universal set (or sample space) is all the elements for a given problem,
   $U=\{0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9\}$  
  
   
- Set $A$ is then defined from the universal set:
  $A=\{0,2,4,6,8\}$  
   
- The *complement* of $A$ is denoted as $A'$ . This is everything *not* in $A$ 
  $A'=\{1,3,5,7,9\}$  

- Set $C$ is a *subset* of $A$ if and only if all elements of $C$ are also *members* of $A$
$C=\{1,3,5\}$
$\therefore C\sub A$  
  
- $5\in A$ , means that 5 is a member (or element) of set $A$

- $n(A)$ , is the number of members of $A$, in this case $n(A)=5$

- $\empty$ or $ \{\}$ denotes a set of zero members, the *empty* or *null* set



### Sets and Venn Diagrams

- $A \cap B$ is the i**N**tersection of sets $A$ and $B$. 
  
  The elements that are in both set $A$ **and** $B$

```math
||{"id":602228091130}||


```


* $A\cup B$ is the **U**nion of sets $A$ and $B$
  
  The elements that are in either set $A$ **or** $B$  (this includes the intersection)

```math
||{"id":418504269715}||


```




* Usually the cardinality (size) of each subset demonstrated on a Venn diagram is written inside the corresponding region.

```
Example 3.2
A sample space of the numbers 1-12 inclusive.
Set A is defined as the set of odd numbers
Set B is defined as the set of prime numbers 

    a) List the sets
    b) Draw a Venn Digram
    c) List these sets:
        i)    A ∩ B
        ii)   A ∪ B
        iii)  A'
        iv)   B only   (A' ∩ B)
    d) Find:
        i)    n(A)
        ii)   Pr(A)
        iii)  n(A ∩ B)
        iv)   Pr(A ∪ B)
```
