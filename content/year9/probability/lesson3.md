### Sets

- A set is a group of *elements*, often defined by a *rule*.

- Sets are defined using curly brackets $\{\text{ } \}$  
  
<br>

```
Example 3.1

List these sets:

1. {arrangements of the letters ACT}

2. {mulitples of 4 less than 20}
```

```math
||{"id":1304824891129}||

### Set Notation

- The universal set (or sample space) is all the elements for a given problem,  
 $U=\mathscr{E}=\lbrace 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 \rbrace$  
  
   
- Set $A$ is then defined from the universal set:  
  $A=\lbrace 0,2,4,6,8 \rbrace$  
   
- The *complement* of $A$ is denoted as $A'$ . This is everything *not* in $A$ : 
  $A'=\lbrace 1,3,5,7,9 \rbrace$  

- Set $C$ is a *subset* of $A$ if and only if all elements of $C$ are also *members* of $A$ :
	$C=\lbrace 2,4,6\rbrace$  
	$\therefore C \subset A$  
  
- $6\in A$ , means that 6 is a member (or element) of set $A$  

- $n(A)$ , is the number of members of $A$, in this case $n(A)=5$  

- $\emptyset$ or $\lbrace \text{ } \rbrace$  denotes a set of zero members, the *empty* or *null* set

### Sets and Venn Diagrams

- $A \cap B$ is the i**N**tersection of sets $A$ and $B$. 
  
  The elements that are in both set $A$ **and** $B$

```math
||{"id":602228091130}||


```



* $A\cup B$ is the **U**nion of sets $A$ and $B$
  
  The elements that are in either set $A$ **or** $B$  (this includes the intersection)

```math
||{"id":418504269715}||


```





* Usually, the cardinality (size) of each subset demonstrated on a Venn diagram is written inside the corresponding region. 
  
```math
||{"id":1208947025257}||


```


```
Example 3.2
A sample space of the numbers 1-12 inclusive.
Set A is defined as the set of odd numbers
Set B is defined as the set of prime numbers 

    a) List the sets
    b) Draw a Venn Digram
    c) List these sets:
        i)    A∩B
        ii)   A∪B
        iii)  A'
        iv)   B only   (A'∩B)
    d) Find:
        i)    n(A)
        ii)   Pr(A)
        iii)  n(A∩B)
        iv)   Pr(A∪B)
```
