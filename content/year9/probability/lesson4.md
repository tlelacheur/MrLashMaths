### Using Arrays

A 2-dimentional array can be used to display the outcomes of a two-step experiment, such as rolling two dice, selecting two items from a list or flipping a coin twice:

<center>
<table border="1" style="text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse">
<tr>
	<td>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
	<td>H</td>
	<td>T</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>   H   </td>
	<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;( H, H )&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
	<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;( H, T )&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>T</td>
	<td>&nbsp;( T, H )&nbsp;</td>
	<td>&nbsp;( T, T )&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
</table>
</center>
<br>

Experiments can be conducted:
- With replacement (independent events)
- Without replacement (dependent events)

<br>

```
Example 4.1 
Two identical counters have a red side (R) and a blue side (B). 
They are each tossed. 
	a) Draw a table to list the sample space. 
	b) Find the probability of obtaining (B, B). 
	c) Find Pr(1 red side only).

Example 4.2
Two letters are chosen at random from the word MATTER without replacement. 
	a) List the outcomes in a table. 
	b) Find the probability that the two letters chosen are both T. 
	c) Find the probability that at least one of the letters is an T
